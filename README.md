# 🚚 DeliveryPulse – Delivery SLA Analytics Dashboard

> **An intelligent analytics platform that helps food delivery companies identify, analyze, and predict SLA (Service Level Agreement) violations using data analytics and machine learning.**

---

## 📌 Overview

DeliveryPulse is a data analytics dashboard designed to help food delivery companies monitor operational performance and reduce delivery delays.

Food delivery companies collect data from multiple systems such as delivery logs, rider assignments, customer complaints, refund records, and order details. Since this information exists in disconnected systems, operations teams struggle to identify why deliveries are delayed and which factors contribute to SLA violations.

DeliveryPulse consolidates these datasets into a single interactive dashboard, enabling users to monitor delivery performance, identify bottlenecks, perform root cause analysis, and predict future SLA violations.

---

## 🚨 Problem Statement

A fast-growing food delivery company stores delivery logs, rider assignment history, customer complaints, refund records, and order details across disconnected systems, but operations teams still cannot identify which delivery patterns consistently lead to SLA violations during peak hours.

As a result:

- Operations teams cannot identify recurring SLA violations.
- Rider performance is difficult to evaluate.
- Peak-hour bottlenecks remain hidden.
- Customer complaints and refunds cannot be linked to operational issues.
- Manual reporting consumes significant time.

DeliveryPulse solves this problem by providing a centralized analytics platform for operational monitoring and predictive insights.

## 🤝 Team Workflow

This repository follows a simple GitHub Flow process so the team can work in parallel without breaking the shared codebase.

- Main stays releasable and only receives reviewed merges.
- Each task starts on a feature branch named with the issue number, such as `feature/12-delay-analysis`.
- Every change is tracked in a GitHub issue before code is written.
- Pull requests must reference the issue and include a short summary, testing notes, and review approval.
- Commit messages use the conventional format, such as `feat: add delay hotspot chart` or `fix: handle missing delivery times`.

See [TEAM_WORKFLOW.md](TEAM_WORKFLOW.md) and [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the full working agreement.
